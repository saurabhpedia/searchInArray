# Search In Array Function

Here, the search_array_by_key function takes three parameters:

`array`: the array of objects to search
`key`: the key to search for within each object
`value`: the value to search for within the specified key
The find method is used to search the array for an object where the value of the key property matches the specified value. If a matching object is found, it is returned. If no matching object is found, undefined is returned.
